# Project 4 Proposal

Currently, AllTrails.com does not have a trail recommender feature on site.
The goal of this added feature would be to increase app downloads and interaction. The more hikes that users log with the app, the more hikes that the system will be able to recommend. It could also be a feature that is behind the pay wall of the AllTrails Pro paid version of the app.

I would like to scrape hiking trail reviews from AllTrails.com for the top ~1,500 trails in California.
Each trail has varying amounts of reviews & ratings. I will use the text reviews to create a recommender system hopefully.

There are significantly less text reviews than star ratings per trail, hence why I'm trying to scrape a good number of trails.

Trail features scraped:
* username
* text review
* star rating
* trail name
* trail region
* hike difficulty
* hike length
* hike type
* total number reviews
